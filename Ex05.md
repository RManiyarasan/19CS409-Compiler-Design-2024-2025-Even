# RECOGNITION OF THE GRAMMAR (a<sup>n</sup>b where n>=10) USING YACC
## Register Number :212224040185
## Date :20-11-25 

## AIM   
To write a YACC program to recognize the grammar a<sup>n</sup>b where n>=10.

## ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
3.	In the lex program, write the translation rules for the variables a and b.
4.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
5.	Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
6.	Compile the yacc program with yacc compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc –d arith_id.y
7.	Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
8.	Enter a string as input and it is identified as valid or invalid.
 
## PROGRAM
```
%{
#include "y.tab.h"
int b_count = 0;  // To count the number of 'b's
%}

%%

"a"         { return A; }         // First character is 'a'
"b"         { b_count++; return B; } // Count 'b's after 'a'

.           { return yytext[0]; }   // Return any other character

%%

int yywrap() {
    return 1;  // End of input
}
```

## RESULT
The YACC program to recognize the grammar anb where n>=10 is executed successfully and the output is verified.
